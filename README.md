  ## Personal Portfolio (Still Figuring It Out ðŸ˜…)

  After learning some React, I thought I had to design my own personal portfolio. This project will focus a lot on detailed UI/UX design then transforming it into real code. Basically: make it look clean, then make it actually work.

  ### Why Iâ€™m Building This
  - **Practice**: I wanted a real project to push my React skills.
  - **Design-first**: Iâ€™m treating Figma like the blueprint and React like the build.
  - **Personal brand**: A place to show my experiences, projects, and contact info.

  ### Current Status
  - Homepage is live.
  - Subpages are under construction (youâ€™ll see disabled nav items for now).
  - UI polish and content are coming next.

  ### Tech Stack
  - **React + TypeScript** (Vite)
  - **Tailwind CSS** for styling
  - **Lucide Icons** for clean icons

  ### Design
  - Main design lives in Figma â€” turning components and spacing into responsive React.

  ### Getting Started
  1. Clone the repo

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

  App runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

  ### Project Structure (simplified)
  - `src/components/` â€” core components like `Homepage`, `Navigation`
  - `src/under_construction/` â€” placeholder pages while I build the real ones
  - `src/styles/` â€” global styles

  ### Roadmap
  - Polish homepage animations and micro-interactions
  - Build out Experiences, Projects, Awards, Hobbies, Blog, Contact
  - Add content and improve accessibility
  - Maybe deploy on Vercel when itâ€™s solid
